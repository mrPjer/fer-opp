fer-opp
=======

Team SilkRoad's solution to [FER](https://www.fer.unizg.hr)'s 2013/14 [OPP](http://www.fer.unizg.hr/predmet/opp) course project.

About
=====
This repository contains the Django application which was built as a solution to the problem presented in [AJ_2_Narudzba_pizze.pdf](https://github.com/mrPjer/fer-opp/blob/master/AJ_2_Narudzba_pizze.pdf). Parts of this specification which were implemented are marked in strikethrough.

The task was to build a simple web page for an imaginary pizza restaurant which allowed the owner to input and update basic information, as well as the contents of the menu. Furthermore, the app had to support taking online orders which workers would then deliver and mark as processed. Finally, the owner had the ability to monitor monthly income, as well as the performance of each worker. Several other features were requested and the full list is present in the aforementioned document.

State
=====
All of the requested features were implemented except for extra options on each specific meal (eg. extra ketchup). Minor bugs are present, but nothing that would affect the stability of the app. 

Documentation
=============
More info about the project, as well as screenshots and various diagrams are present in the documentation files written in Croatian. The documentation was delivered in two cycles, with the final document being present in [SilkRoad_Rev2.pdf](https://github.com/mrPjer/fer-opp/blob/master/SilkRoad_Rev2.pdf).
